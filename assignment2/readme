This is the program extended the example. That is my own using framework for opengl at linux.
All draw functions are used to draw different base graphics by different parameters.

Notes:
	* using lib of "freeglut". You can change it to what you want like "glut".
	* myDisplay() Function just means the initial clearing operation.
	* All I want to draw are the function named my*().

Using:
	g++ example.cpp -lglut
